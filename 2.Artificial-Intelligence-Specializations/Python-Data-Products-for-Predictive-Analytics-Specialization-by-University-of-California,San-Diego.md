- Understand how to compute basic statistics using real-world datasets of consumer activities, like product reviews and more
- Use Python to create interactive data visualizations to make meaningful predictions and build simple demo systems
- Perform simple regressions and classifications on datasets using machine learning libraries

## SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN
`machine learning` `python programming` `predictive analytics` `data processing` `data visualization (dataviz)` `python libraries` `data pre processing` `web scraping` `big data products` `recommender systems`

## About this Specialization
- Python data products are powering the AI revolution. Top companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix use predictive analytics to improve the products and services we use every day. Take your Python skills to the next level and learn to make accurate predictions with data-driven systems and deploy machine learning models with this four-course Specialization from UC San Diego.
- This Specialization is for learners who are proficient with the basics of Python. You’ll start by creating your first data strategy. You’ll also develop statistical models, devise data-driven workflows, and learn to make meaningful predictions for a wide-range of business and research purposes. Finally, you’ll use design thinking methodology and data science techniques to extract insights from a wide range of data sources. This is your chance to master one of the technology industry’s most in-demand skills.
- Python Data Products for Predictive Analytics is taught by Professor Ilkay Altintas, Ph.D. and Julian McAuley. Dr. Alintas is a prominent figure in the data science community and the designer of the highly-popular Big Data Specialization on Coursera. She has helped educate hundreds of thousands of learners on how to unlock value from massive datasets.

- This first course in the four-course specialization Python Data Products for Predictive Analytics, introducing the basics of reading and manipulating datasets in Python. In this course, you will learn what a data product is and go through several Python libraries to perform data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

- This course will introduce you to the field of data science and prepare you for the next three courses in the Specialization: Design Thinking and Predictive Analytics for Data Products, Meaningful Predictive Modeling, and Deploying Machine Learning Models. At each step in the specialization, you will gain hands-on experience in data manipulation and building your skills, eventually culminating in a capstone project encompassing all the concepts taught in the specialization.

- This second course in the four-course specialization Python Data Products for Predictive Analytics, building on the data processing covered in Course 1 and introducing the basics of designing predictive models in Python. In this course, you will understand the fundamental concepts of statistical learning and learn various methods of building predictive models. At each step in the specialization, you will gain hands-on experience in data manipulation and building your skills, eventually culminating in a capstone project encompassing all the concepts taught in the specialization.

- This third course will help us to evaluate and compare the models we have developed in previous courses. So far we have developed techniques for regression and classification, but how low should the error of a classifier be (for example) before we decide that the classifier is "good enough"? Or how do we decide which of two regression algorithms is better?

- By the end of this course you will be familiar with diagnostic techniques that allow you to evaluate and compare classifiers, as well as performance measures that can be used in different regression and classification scenarios. We will also study the training/validation/test pipeline, which can be used to ensure that the models you develop will generalize well to new (or "unseen") data.

- This forth course we will learn about Recommender Systems (which we will study for the Capstone project), and also look at deployment issues for data products. By the end of this course, you should be able to implement a working recommender system (e.g. to predict ratings, or generate lists of related products), and you should understand the tools and techniques required to deploy such a working system on real-world, large-scale datasets.

- This course is the final course in the Python Data Products for Predictive Analytics Specialization, building on the previous three courses (Basic Data Processing and Visualization, Design Thinking and Predictive Analytics for Data Products, and Meaningful Predictive Modeling). At each step in the specialization, you will gain hands-on experience in data manipulation and building your skills, eventually culminating in a capstone project encompassing all the concepts taught in the specialization.
